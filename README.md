# Database

### Relational Database System

#### Tools and Techniques
I used two main tools. The first one being Draw.io which I used to create my ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) to show how my tables within my Database's are related. Additionally, the other tool I used was Microsoft Excel, which is the tool I used to create my Data dictionary.

Similarly to my tools I used two main techniques; the first being an Entity Relationship Diagram. Within my Entity Relationship Diagram I created 5 tables, which were called: Enemies, Heores, Enemy_skills, Hero_Skills and finally Skills. The other technique I used was a Data dictionary, which was a table within Microsoft Excel that showed the information that was going to be in each table.

Screenshots of techniques:

Here is my Data dictionary:

### User stories
I needed to create 10 user stories for my Relational Database System and here they are:

As a user I would like to see how much damage an enemy does

As a user I would like to see how much health an enemy has

As a user I would like to see how much damage a hero does

As a user I would like to see how much health a hero has

As a user I would like to be able to create and add new heroes using a form

As a user I would like to be able to create and add new enemies using a form

As a user I would like to see what a heores stats are

As a user I would like to see what a heroes stats are

As a user I would like to be able to view a heroes level

As a user I would like to be able to view an enemies level


### Forms
Here at two forms; one shows a form of an Enemy and the other shows a form of a Hero.
