# Database

### Relational Database System

#### Tools and Techniques
I used two main tools. The first one being Draw.io which I used to create my ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) to show how my tables within my Database's are related. Additionally, the other tool I used was Microsoft Excel, which is the tool I used to create my Data dictionary.

Similarly to my tools I used two main techniques; the first being an Entity Relationship Diagram. Within my Entity Relationship Diagram I created 5 tables, which were called: Enemies, Heores, Enemy_skills, Hero_Skills and finally Skills. The other technique I used was a Data dictionary, which was a table within Microsoft Excel that showed the information that was going to be in each table.
